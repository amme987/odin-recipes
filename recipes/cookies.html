    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Delicious chocolate chip cookies that are huge and look like Panera's big
      chocolate chip cookies. Really delicious. Helped me realize that I should
      always use chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips for a better time.
      Best fresh and with milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found this recipe on the
      <a
        href="https://www.designeatrepeat.com/panera-chocolate-chip-cookies/"
        alt="Site for chocolate chip cookies"
        >internet</a
      >. The only thing I change in the recipe is the bake time, because one of
      the comments said that they worked at Panera and put their cookies in the
      oven at 330 degrees for 15 minutes. I follow those directions instead of
      the recipe instructions because I want the cookies to be as close to
      Panera's cookies as they can get.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1.5 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons baking soda</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup dark chocolate chunks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 330 degrees.</li>
      <li>
        Use a knife to chop 1/2 cup of the chocolate chunks into small shards
        and slivers.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, add the butter and cover with a paper towel. Melt the
        butter until it is melted and hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour butter into a larger bowl then add in white sugar and brown sugar
        and use a spatula to stir unil combined. Add in egg and vanilla, then
        mix. Next, add in baking soda, baking powder, and salt and mix again.
        Add in flour and mix until all the flour disappears into the dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the 1/2 cup of chopped chunks and 1/2 cup of whole chunks into the
        douhgh and mix. Allow dough to sit for 1-2 minutes to slightly set so
        it's not as sticky.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop dough into 3-tablespoon
        sized scoops
        <strong
          >then gently roll into your hands to create a ball. Flatten the tops
          so that they're a thick disc vs. a round ball. See image in post for
          reference. Without flattening, your cookies will be thicker and more
          cakey</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>Bake at 330 minutes for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Remove from oven and place entire pan on a cooling rack. Allow the
        cookies to cool on the hot pan for 10-15 minutes before removing them.
        This will allow them to finish baking on the hot pan. Once cooled, use a
        spatula to transfer them to a wire cooling rack.
