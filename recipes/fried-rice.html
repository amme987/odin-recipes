    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is my favorite fried rice I've found so far, which I got from
      <a href="https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/fried-rice-recipe/">this</a> site.
      I add shrimp in mine and put a use a bag of frozen peas and carrots.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 medium carrots</li>
      <li>1 small onion</li>
      <li>1/2 cup frozen peas</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>salt and pepper</li>
      <li>4 cups rice</li>
      <li>3 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>3-4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons oyster sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1/2 tablespoon of butter in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat
        until melted. Add egg, and cook until scrambled, stirring occasionally.
        Remove egg, and transfer to a separate plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add an additional 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and heat until melted.
        Add carrots, onion, peas and garlic, and season with a generous pinch of
        salt and pepper. Sauté for about 5 minutes or until the onion and
        carrots are soft. Increase heat to high, add in the remaining 1 1/2
        tablespoons of butter, and stir until melted. Immediately add the rice,
        green onions, soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using), and stir until
        combined. Continue sautéing for an additional 3 minutes to fry the rice,
        stirring occasionally. (I like to let the rice rest for a bit between
        stirs so that it can crisp up on the bottom.) Then add in the eggs and
        stir to combine. Remove from heat, and stir in the sesame oil until
        combined. Taste and season with extra soy sauce, if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 3
        days.

    </ol>
