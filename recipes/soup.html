    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is homemade chicken soup the way my mom makes it, but is modified to
      be made with an instant pot instead of a stock pot. Makes delicious soup
      with just a few ingredients. Since I didn't want to make soup and take a
      picture of it just for this project, the photo was taken from the
      internet.
